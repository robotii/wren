Like the [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren), Wren's community is small,
but it exists!

## User group

There's one Wren user group, and it's the [official Wren mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wren-lang). Please join it and
say hello! There are no strangers to Wren, just friends we haven't met yet.

## Third-party libraries

There are some third-party libraries that are written in Wren. Here's the list:

- [wren-test](https://github.com/gsmaverick/wren-test), a testing framework
- [Please](https://github.com/EvanHahn/wren-please), an assertion library
- [wren-colors](https://github.com/gsmaverick/wren-colors) for printing colored
  messages to the terminal
- [3D vectors for Wren](https://github.com/EvanHahn/wren-vector3d)

A few people have also added Wren bindings for other languages:

- [Rust: tilpner/wren-sys](https://github.com/tilpner/wren-sys)
- [Rust: pwoolcoc/wren-sys](https://github.com/pwoolcoc/wren-sys)
- [Rust: pwoolcoc/wren-rs](https://github.com/pwoolcoc/wren-rs)

## Editor integrations

If you want Wren syntax highlighting in your editor, look no further:

- [Vim](https://github.com/lluchs/vim-wren)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/v2e4lisp/wren-mode.el)
